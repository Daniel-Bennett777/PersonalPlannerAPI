This Project encompasses the idea of 3 people wanting to create a platform to share dates for events, and also allows the users to check the weather for those events. Some extra features include : profile pages unique to each user, dropdown menus for functionality and easy navigation, Mobile friendly design, and a Calendar to check events and times. Thank you for taking the time to look at our Deployed application using DIGITAL OCEAN services.
